In this research work, we first considered one article as a reference article and then we checked the articles we needed according to that article.
The dataset of our article was not publicly available and required authors' approval, so we found implementations through GitHub using the datasets of other articles, and then checked them and checked the results.
The implementations were done using Python software.
Then we divided the results into two categories
The results of the first group
The results of the second group
And at the end, all the results were compared
And then we reached the general results, which were the results of the implementations
